# John Deere Sprinkler Control System

Main project in collaboration with *John Deere* for the undergrad course “**Analysis of Control Systems**”, which delves mainly into *Classic and Modern Control*.


The John Deere Sprinkler Control System is a computerized irrigation management solution designed to stabilize the operation of a 3D-printed sprayer model. Utilizing the NUCLEO-F103RB development board equipped with the STM32F103RB MCU, this project provides control over a DC motor, where the model is attached.
