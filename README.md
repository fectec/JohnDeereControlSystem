The John Deere Sprinkler Control System is a computerized irrigation management solution designed to stabilize the operation of a 3D-printed sprayer model. Utilizing the NUCLEO-F103RB development board equipped with the STM32F103RB MCU, this project provides precise control over a DC motor to which the sprayer model is attached.
